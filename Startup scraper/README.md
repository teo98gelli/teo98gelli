#### Description: This simple programme allows the user to import a standard csv of Italian finacial statement (downloaded from the website https://www.creditsafe.com/it/it.html) and outputs profitability KPIs (revenue current year, revenue past year, revene growth, EBIT current year, EBIT past year, and EBIT griwth). The project folder contains 5 distinct files:    - The current file title: "README.md"     - "project.py", which is the main code and is divided in 4 functions: - main(), which its sole purpose is to call the other three functions listed below            - read_csv(filename), which gets the name of the file to read and returns a list of dictionaries concerning the different financial statement data and their relative definition (within which, among the different variables, it is possible to find company information, profit&loss data, cashflow data, and balance sheet data, all divided by title, current year, past year, notes, and tag)            - KPIs(bilancio), which gers the list containing financial statement data and outputs profitability KPIs. This is done by specifically indicating the position of the financial data given that the csv file format is standard independently by the company            - pri(bilancio, kpis), which gets the list containing financial statement data and the list containing the KPIs, and then prints the data in a determined format    - "bilancioprova.csv", which is the csv on which the programme has been tested    - "test_project.py", which allows through pytest to check if the main code raises issues  Moreover, given the standardize nature of the Italian finacial statements csv download, it will be possible to add more KPIs to calculated, dividing per category, and improve the way the data are visualzied.
